## Welcome to the Code Boola Python Puzzles!

We've prepared a couple of puzzles for you to try out with your new python skills! 

###  The problems

There are 4 folders: easy, medium, hard, and impossible. We recommend everyone should start with the easy folder to get a good grasp of the skills that we talked a lot about! 
Don't worry if you get stuck -- I know we went over a lot of material fast, so just call one of our mentors, and we'll help you out! 

There are 10 easy problems, 6 medium problems, 3 hard problems, and 1 impossible problem. Really. Don't start with the impossible one. 

### Checking your solutions

How do you check if you are right? Run the verify function from the boola_puzzles folder. 

	cd ~/code-boola/puzzles
	python verify.py
	
This will give you a log as it checks each of your scripts in each of the folders! It'll tally up the scores and give you a final summary of your progress! Have fun and try your best! We'll be around to help with whatever you need. 

#### Thanks for coming to Code Boola!
We really do hope you are enjoying your time here!
