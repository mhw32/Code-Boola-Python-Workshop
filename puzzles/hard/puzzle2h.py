# Back to strings we go! Let's see
# if you've mastered the fundamentals.

# ------------------------------------ 

# Let's start out a little friendlier.
# You know what a palindrome is? 
# It's when the word spelled forwards
# is the same as the word spelled backwards.

# For example ==> racecar.

# Can you write something to test if a 
# word is a palindrome or not?

# Another thing: remove all spaces in the 
# string before doing thing. 
# Also: empty string is not a palindrome.

# Don't know how? Check out the str.replace
# function. Google it!

# s = "asd"
# s.replace("a", "b") => "bsd"

# EXAMPLES: 
# palindrome("racecar") => True
# palindrome("sample") => False
# palindrome("do geese see god") ==> True

def palindrome(s):
  pass
