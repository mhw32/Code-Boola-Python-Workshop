# INSTRUCTIONS: 

# Here we are going to play with some
# numbers! This is a pretty famous 
# computer science problem called
# FizzBuzz.

# Write a program that returns a list of the 
# integers from 1 to an argument n. But for multiples 
# of three include "Fizz" instead of the number, 
# and for the multiples of five include "Buzz". 
# For numbers which are multiples of both 
# three and five include "FizzBuzz".

# EXAMPLE:
# fizzbuzz(5) => [1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz]
# fizzbuzz(0) => []
# fizzbuzz(1) => [1]

def fizzbuzz(n):
