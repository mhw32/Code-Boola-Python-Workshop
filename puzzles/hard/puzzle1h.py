# INSTRUCTIONS: 

# Here we are going to play with some
# numbers! This is a pretty famous 
# computer science problem called
# FizzBuzz.

# Write a program that prints the integers
# from 1 to an argument n. But for multiples 
# of three print "Fizz" instead of the number, 
# and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". 
# For numbers which are multiples of both 
# three and five print "FizzBuzz".

# EXAMPLE:
# fizzbuzz(5):
# 1
# 2
# Fizz
# 4
# Buzz
