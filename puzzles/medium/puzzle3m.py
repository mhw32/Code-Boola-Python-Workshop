# Wow! You are doing this way faster 
# than I thought you would. Slooooow
# doooowwwwwnnn...

# INSTRUCTIONS: 

# I almost forgot about working with 
# strings. Can't forget that!

# Write a function that takes a single
# *string* argument and returns the
# reverse of the string.

# Using a FOR loop is optional.

# EXAMPLE:
# reverse("blah") => "halb"
# reverse("test") => "tset"
# reverse("racecar") => "racecar"

# HINT:
# You probably want to index through a 
# string. Remember s[0] is the first
# index of the string and s[len(s)-1] 
# is the last index of string.

# The sequence is:
# s[0], s[1], ..., s[len(s)-2], s[len(s)-1]

# How do you flip this with a for loop?

def reverse(s):
  pass
