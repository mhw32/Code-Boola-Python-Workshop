# You should check that you are getting
# some points with the verify script
# before you keep going!

# INSTRUCTIONS: 

# I'm a sad PhD student and I really need
# to use computer science to help me 
# with my math calculations. Will you 
# help me?

# Write a function that takes a positive 
# integer as an argument and returns 
# the sum of the digits.

# EXAMPLE:
# sum_digits(13) => 4
# sum_digits(1000000) => 1
# sum_digits(123456789) => 45
# sum_digits(9) => 9

# HINT: 
# You probably want to loop through each 
# individual digit in the number, i.e if you
# 12345, you want [1,2,3,4,5] to be able to 
# compute the sum.

# To do that, try this:
# if n is your number:
#   list(str(n)) would do the trick!

# You can use max(lst) on a lst to 
# find the maximum element in the lst.

def sum_digits(n):
  pass
