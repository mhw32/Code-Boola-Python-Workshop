# Welcom to the medium section. We
# applaud you greatly for reaching this
# point! Let's see how you do with 
# something a little tougher.

# ------------------------------------ 
# INSTRUCTIONS: 

# Same PhD student here! I need your 
# help again for my thesis. 

# Write a function which takes an 
# integer n (base 10) and returns 
# the largest digit in n.

# Here's the catch though! You can ONLY
# use a WHILE loop.

# EXAMPLE:
# largest_digit(12345) => 5
# largest_digit(11111) => 1
# largest_digit(54321) => 5
# largest_digit(5432123456789123) => 9

# HINT: 
# You probably want to loop through each 
# individual digit in the number, i.e if you
# 12345, you want [1,2,3,4,5] to be able to 
# check which one is the biggest!

# To do that, try this:
# if n is your number:
#   list(str(n)) would do the trick!

def largest_digit(n):
    pass
