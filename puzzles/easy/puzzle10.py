# Last one of the group! 
# You a deserve a break after this one.

# ------------------------------------ 
# INSTRUCTIONS: 

# Let's keep working with strings
# a little bit. You can actually convert
# from strings to numbers and back!

# Check out these built-in Python functions.
# Try them out in the Python interactive terminal!

# chr(...) => takes a number and converts
#              it into a letter.
# chr(97) => 'a'               
# chr(98) => 'b'
# chr(99) => 'c'

# ord(...) => takes a letter and converts 
#              it into a number.
# ord('a') => 97
# ord('b') => 98
# ord('c') => 99

# Now using these...
# Write a function that takes a *string*
# argument and converts each character 
# into a number and sums all the "numbers"
# in the string. 

# For example, "cat" => ["c", "a", "t"], 
# which is [99, 97, 116] => 312

# EXAMPLES:
# convert("cat") => 312
# convert("dog") => 314
# convert("boola") => 525

def convert(s):
  pass
