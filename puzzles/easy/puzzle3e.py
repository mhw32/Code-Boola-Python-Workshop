# Alright, you almost there. 
# Things might get a little harder :)
# Not too much though.

# ------------------------------------ 
# INSTRUCTIONS: 

# Let's continue with lists. They are 
# pretty darn important! Remember 
# FOR loops are your friends. 

# Write the function that takes in an
# integer argument and returns a list 
# with all the integers from 0 to that
# argument - 1. 

# For example, loops(5) should return
# [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

# EXAMPLES

# loops(5) => [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
# loops(1) => [0]
# loops(0) => []
# loops(10) => [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

def loops(n):
    pass
