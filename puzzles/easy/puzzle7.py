# Alright, you almost there. 
# Things might get a little harder :)
# Not too much though.

# ------------------------------------ 
# INSTRUCTIONS: 

# Let's continue with lists. They are 
# pretty darn important! Remember 
# FOR loops are your friends. 

# Write the procedures

# nth_tail(lst, n)
# every_nth(lst, n)

# nth_tail takes a lst and returns the list, 
# minus the first n elements

# every_nth takes a list lst and returns a new list comprising
# every nth element of the original list.

# EXAMPLES
# nth_tail([1,2,3,4,5,6], 3) => [4,5,6]
# nth_tail([1,2,3,4,5,6], 1) => [2,3,4,5,6]
# nth_tail([1,2,3,4,5,6], 7) => []
# nth_tail([], 3) => []

# every_nth([1,2,3,4,5,6], 2) => [2 4 6]
# every_nth([1,2,3,4,5,6], 5) => [5]
# every_nth([1,2,3,4], 5) => []
# every_nth([1,2,3,4,5], 1) => [1,2,3,4,5]

def nth_tail(lst):

def every_nth(lst):
