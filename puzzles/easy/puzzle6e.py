# Hey! Welcome to our little puzzle games. 

# ------------------------------------ 
# INSTRUCTIONS:

# We are all wondering who is going to 
# be president next year! Maybe code will
# tell us!

# Write a function president()
# that takes no arguments and
# returns a *string* indicating
# your preferred winner of the 
# upcoming presidential election.

# EXAMPLES: (yours WILL be different)
# president() => "George Washington"

# HINT: 
# Don't forget to use quotations marks 
# around your strings!
