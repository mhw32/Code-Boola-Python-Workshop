# INSTRUCTIONS:

# Write a function that takes a single
# input to calculate its factorial. 

# Remember that the factorial of 0
# is 1! And any factorial of a negative 
# number should return None.

# EXAMPLE:
# factorial(1) => 1
# factorial(10) => 3628800
# factorial(-1) => None
# factorial(0) => 1
# factorial(4) => 24

# HINT:
# The easiest way is to use a for loop!
