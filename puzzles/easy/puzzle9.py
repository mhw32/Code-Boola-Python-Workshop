# INSTRUCTIONS: 

# I almost forgot about working with 
# strings. Can't forget that!

# Write a function that takes a single
# *string* argument and returns the
# reverse of the string.

# Using a FOR loop is optional.

# EXAMPLE:
# reverse("blah") => "halb"
# reverse("test") => "tset"
# reverse("racecar") => "racecar"

def reverse(s):
  pass
