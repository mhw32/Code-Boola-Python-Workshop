# INSTRUCTIONS: 

# I'm a sad PhD student and I really need
# to use computer science to help me 
# with my math calculations. Will you 
# help me?

# Write a function that takes a positive 
# integer as an argument and returns 
# the sum of the digits.

# EXAMPLE:
# sum_digits(13) => 4
# sum_digits(1000000) => 1
# sum_digits(123456789) => 45
# sum_digits(9) => 9
