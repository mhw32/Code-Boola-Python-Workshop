# More lists! Can't get enough of them!

# ------------------------------------ 
# INSTRUCTIONS:

# Write a function createList()
# that takes in six inputs. These
# inputs can be a mix of both 
# numbers and strings. These inputs
# are all up to you - you decide 
# what they are. The function will
# then take these inputs and put them
# into a list. Then the function will
# return the list.

# EXAMPLES: 
# createList('hi', 34, 0, '64', 'five', 100) => ['hi', 34, 0, '64', 'five', 100]

# HINT: 
# Don't forget to use quotations marks 
# around your strings!
