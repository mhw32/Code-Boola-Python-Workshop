# More lists! Can't get enough of them!

# ------------------------------------ 
# INSTRUCTIONS:

# Write a function createList()
# that takes in two argument. The 
# first argument is a list and the second
# argument is a variable. We want to add
# the variable to the end of the list!
# Return the list after you've appended
# the variable

# EXAMPLES: 
# createList(['hi', 34, 0, '64', 'five'], 100) => ['hi', 34, 0, '64', 'five', 100]

# HINT: 
# Don't forget to use quotations marks 
# around your strings! 

# if lst is a list, to append a variable x
# to lst, do lst.append(x)

def createList(lst, x):
    pass
