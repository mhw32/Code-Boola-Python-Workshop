# Hey! Welcome to our little puzzle games. 
# If you are just starting, this is the right 
# place to be!

# <-- you see this "hashtag"?
# It means that this line is a COMMENT, meaning 
# that no code is in it. 
# You can write anything you want and it won't matter:

# ALSKDJALSKDJASLKDj
# No problem. 

# Most people use these to comment about what they 
# are doing in their code.
# You should too!

# ------------------------------------ 
# INSTRUCTIONS: Let's start out easy. 

# We are all wondering who is going to 
# be president next year! Maybe code will
# tell us!

# Write a function president()
# that takes no arguments and
# returns a *string* indicating
# your preferred winner of the 
# upcoming presidential election.

def president():
  pass # <-- This means, delete me and replace me with code!

# EXAMPLES: (yours WILL be different)
# president() => "George Washington"
