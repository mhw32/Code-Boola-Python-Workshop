# Great job! You got to puzzle 2. 
# Hopefully puzzle 1 was not too bad. 
# If it was, let us know and we can 
# go over it with you. 

# ------------------------------------ 
# INSTRUCTIONS: 

# Everyone knows about the pythagorean 
# theoreom. You know... x^2 + y^2 = z^2

# Write a procedure hypotenuse(x,y)
# that takes as arguments positive integers x and y
# and uses the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the 
# hypotenuse of the right triangle with sides of length
# x and y. The function should RETURN a value.

# EXAMPLES:
# hypotenuse(3,4)  => 5
# hypotenuse(5,12) => 13
# hypotenuse(1,1)  => 1.4142135623730951
